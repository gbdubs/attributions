# Attributions

This package provides common structures and utilities for reasoning
about content attribution in creative projects. The goal is to make
it easier to "do the right thing": showing clear history of parties 
whose work was used, and clearly identifying their contributions.

This package is one I'll seek to maintain and grow over time.
